# Genetic-Networks

This work focuses on the numerical analysis of genetic networks in yeast and ecoli organisms. The networks of genetic regulation are represented as graphs, allowing for analysis of certain patterns or "motifs" in the regulation. Comparing the rate of occurances of certain motifs such as feed forward loops (see image below) in randomized networks compared to real networks can provide insight as to the importance of such motifs. This indicates possible advantages or disadvantages of certain patterns in an organisms genome.

For more information on this particular analysis, refer to the included paper.
